# Portier + Nginx auth_request

This is a small Go web application that can be used with Nginx `auth_request`
to protect any virtual host in Nginx. No need for application support, or even
just to protect static files!

Documentation is a work-in-progress, but `./test-app/server.conf` contains an
example configuration.
